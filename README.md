Agricultural-crop-prediction-in-india

It focuses on analysing agricultural crops in India and to discover the best model for crop prediction, which can help farmers decide the type of crop to grow based on the climatic changes. The goal is to gain insights into various factors influencing crop production and develop predictive models for crop yield. Project Overview In this project- we explore a dataset containing historical data on crop production in different regions of India. We aim to answer questions such as: What are the major crops grown in India? How does crop production vary across different states? Can we develop a model to predict crop yield based on these factors?
